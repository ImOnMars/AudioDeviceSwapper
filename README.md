# Audio Device Swapper
Lightweight script to iterate through multiple sound devices on Windows with hotkeys (using NirCmd)

---

**How To Use**: Edit the script, modify the config section constants and add your audio devices.

Variables (current device index) are stored in a .ini file by default to persist script & PC restarts.

**Note**: I made this for myself and upload it here in case anybody else wants to use it. Feel free to submit any issues or pull requests for bugs & features but no promises for delivery (other than large bugs).

### Requirements
* [AutoHotkey](https://autohotkey.com/download/)
* [NirCmd](http://nircmd.nirsoft.net/)
